# Notes for lecture 2: Kalman Filter

## measurement_update.cpp
In this C++ code, the measurement update function returns two values: the newly computed mean and variance. Usually, a tuple or structshould be used in C++ to return more than one value from a function and easily assign them later to multiple variables. For more information on tuples and structs take a look at this link.
